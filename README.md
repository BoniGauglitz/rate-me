Rate-Me
=======

Rate Me is an Android 2.3+ library that shows dialog to suggest the user to rate the application in the Google Play Store.

With a little twist: if the rating is positive, we take the user to the Play Store directly. Otherwise, we ask him for feedback via email. (This is all configurable.)

How to integrate
================

## Eclipse

1. Download and extract the ZIP file
2. Import the sources: File > Import > Existing projects into workspace > Select directory > add LibraryRateMe
3. Add it as a library: Right click on your project > Android > Library: Add > LibraryRateMe

## Gradle

Add this to your project's build.gradle file:

```xml
dependencies {
    compile 'com.androidsx:ratemelib:X.Y.Z@aar'
}
```

You can see the last version in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cratemelib)

How to use
==========

The integration is very simple: mimic [this example](https://github.com/androidsx/rate-me/blob/master/SampleProject/src/com/androidsx/rateme/demo1/SampleProject.java) to link the dialog from your own button.

When you want to use this library you need choose the icon for your dialg.

```java

			.setLogoResourceId(R.drawable.icon)
```

If you donÂ´t pass the icon, the library will default the icon that has the name `ic_launcher`.

If you use the goToMail Dialog in `true`, you need to configure the company email in `setEmail`

You have different options to configure the library and this is a example :

```java
			new DialogRateMe.Builder(this)
						.setDialogColor(Color.White)
						.setIconCloseColorFilter(Color.DKGRAY)
						.setLineDividerColor(Color.BLUE)
						.setLogoResourceId(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
						.setRateButtonBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE)
						.setRateButtonPressedBackgroundColor(Color.RED)
						.setRateButtonTextColor(Color.White)
						.setGoToMail(true)
						.setLogoResourceId(R.drawable.icon)
						.setShowOKButtonByDefault(false)
						.setEmail(getString(R.string.support_email))
						.setShowShareButton(false)
						.setTextColor(Color.BLUE)
						.setTitleBackgroundColor(Color.White)
						.setTitleTextColor(Color.BLUE)
						.build()
						.show(getFragmentManager(), "dialog");
```

This Library can be opened automatically by calling the method onStart in our project.

```java
			@Override
					protected void onStart() {
							super.onStart();
							final int launchTimes = 5;
							final int installDate = 20;
							new RateMeDialogTimer(installDate, launchTimes);
							RateMeDialogTimer.onStart(this);
							if (RateMeDialogTimer.shouldShowRateDialog(this)) {
									AlertMenu();
							}

					}
```

##CustomCriteria

The default criteria to show the dialog is as below:

* App is launched more than 20 days later than installation.
* App is launched more than 5 times

you can change this settings [here](https://github.com/androidsx/rate-me/blob/master/SampleProject/src/com/androidsx/rateme/demo1/SampleProject.java)
